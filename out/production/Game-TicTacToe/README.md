# Game-TicTacToe

### _NB_: _This is a raw code implementation, as a beginner I just used raw codes to get a output which is similar to the game. But inshaallah I will be trying to make a proper one soon._

This is my first try as a beginner. I tried to create a very familiar game "TIcTacToe" with my own logics. Hope you find it useful. I'm really thrilled as it was my 1st project. I'm hoping to go forward and update it eventually.
Well, this all started when I was learning the 2D array and OOP together. While practising (it was a 3 by 3 matrix), suddenly a thought crossed my mind that, this 2D array can be used as tictactoe, as the output structure was similar. That's when I thought I should give it a try. And I started working on it. As a 1st timer it took me a lot of time. I had to test so many  times. But eventually I got the whole idea and my excitement and interest increased a lot more.
