# ðŸŽ® Game-TicTacToe

A simple console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built in Java using **OOP** and **2D arrays**.  
This was my **first ever coding project**, created while learning about Object-Oriented Programming and arrays.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Two-player mode
- 3Ã—3 grid layout using 2D arrays
- Simple command-line interface
- Beginner-friendly implementation

## ðŸ“š Learning Journey
"This project started when I realized a 3Ã—3 matrix I was practicing on could be used as a Tic Tac Toe board. I challenged myself to make the game using only the basics of OOP and 2D arrays. It took a lot of trial and error, but it boosted my confidence and made me love problem-solving!"

**Fun fact: I built this without any DSA knowledge â€” only 2D arrays and basic OOP concepts.**

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Add single-player mode with AI

- Improve input validation

- Add a replay option without restarting the program

- Add a GUI version with Java Swing or JavaFX
