# Game-TicTacToe

This is my first try as a beginner. I tried to creat a very familliar game "TIcTacToe" with my own logics. Hope you find it useful. I'm really thrilled as it was my 1st project. I'm hoping to go forward and update it eventually.
Well, this all started when I was learing the 2D array and OOP together. While practising (it was a 3 by 3 matrix), suddenly a thought crossed my mind that, this 2D array can be used as tictactoe, as the output structure was simillar. That's when I thought I should give it a try. And I started working on it. As a 1st timer it took me a lot of time. I had to test so many  times. But eventually I got the whole idea and my excitement and interest increaded a lot more.
